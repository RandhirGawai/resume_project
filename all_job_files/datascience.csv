You will probably like working with us if...
1) You like the ownership, camaraderie and chaos of a start-up environment
Start-ups are not right for everyone. Things move quickly and change frequently. Start-ups haven't """"made it"""" yet. We have to convince customers we are valuable enough to them. We must be scrappy and flexible. Everyone will wear lots of hats.
But: if you have future aspirations of being an entrepreneur or leader, you'll find few better learning grounds. You'll learn by doing. You'll be given a ton of trust and responsibility. You'll see very transparently how we operate and make decisions. Your work will absolutely matter to the success of our company.
2) You value learning and have a growth mindset
Sundial is founded on the idea that slope is far more important than intercept. We are a learning environment, and all of us have something to teach and learn from each other. We invest heavily in learning sessions, sharing insights, and reflecting on our growth. We are also very well connected within the open-source frontend developer community (React, next.js etc) and lean heavily into that network to learn and make good decisions. Wondering what went into designing d3Let's get on a call with Mike Bostock. ;)
3) You're interested in understanding how companies grow, and how data plays a role
Unlocking the secrets of data is our bread and butter. How do successful companies growHow do different types of businesses create value for users in an economically scalable wayIf you find this area to be as fascinating as we do, that's awesome, because you're going to become an expert in this domain. :)
4) You love to solve engineering problems at the intersection of data science and design problems in the booming data analytics space. Data scientists unlock the secrets of data using complex algorithms. We believe that how they are presented are as important as the quality of secrets themselves. This poses novel and unique engineering challenges that require a creative and inquisitive mind for solving them. Some of the challenges are building a platform that enables many different ways to explore and explain the data.

Data Analytics and Strategic Insights Analyst (Dasia),Strategic Alliance Management Services,3 - 8 years,Not Disclosed,"New Delhi,Delhi",1 day ago,1,37,"1. POSITION VACANT: Data Analytics and Strategic Insights Analyst (DASIA), International Development Agency (IDA), New Delhi

2. ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND:

Our client is a respected International Development Agency (IDA) working in almost all areas of human development. Together with the Government of India and development partners, the IDA is focused on eradicating poverty, reducing inequalities, strengthening local governance, enhancing community resilience, protecting the environment, supporting policy initiatives and institutional reforms, and accelerating sustainable development for all.

Our client works in close association with the national and state governments, and diverse development actors, to deliver people-centric results, for the most vulnerable and marginalized communities. As the lead for collective action on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the international development agency fraternity, the IDA is committed to supporting the Government of Indias national development vision and priorities and accelerating the achievement of the SDGs for the people and the planet.

The IDA is seeking future-smart development professionals, to join their team to support India in achieving national and globally agreed goals. As part of the IDA team, the post-holder will focus on working with diverse stakeholders to find country-specific solutions that lead to sustainable development and reach those furthest behind first.

Project Description:

More than half of all livelihoods in India are primarily dependent on agriculture. A massive 54.6% of the total workforce is engaged in agricultural and allied sector activities and 57% of rural households are directly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. However, the agricultural sector faces multiple challenges like small landholding, declining productivity, rising input costs, declining farm income, adverse impact of climate change, and decline in the percentage share of workers engaged in the agriculture sector. Agricultural production shocks have huge social and financial repercussions, impacting rural income levels, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and poverty rates.

The Government of Indias flagship schemes, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and Kisan Credit Card/ Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (KCC/ MISS), have become important tools to strengthen the resilience of Indian farmers. The schemes provide a safety net for farmers by providing financial risk protection against natural calamities and catastrophic events including pests, climate uncertainties and environmental shocks. Apart from providing comprehensive risk coverage for the entire crop cycle, PMFBY also enables direct claim transfer into farmers accounts through e-remittance. Additionally, to address agrarian distress, MISS provides cheap and hassle-free credit to millions of farmers to ensure continued investment in agriculture for mechanisation, modernisation of agriculture practices and eventually, enhanced productivity.
The IDA is supporting the Ministry of Agriculture in setting up a Central Program Management Unit (CPMU) for the implementation of PMFBY and KCC, focused on improving institutional and programme responsiveness, increasing coverage and better access among marginalised and excluded farm households, offering innovative measures and supporting mechanisms for agri-value chain financing, risk management and reduced crop loss for the rural population in India.

Data Analytics Professional,Akraya Solutions Pvt Ltd,3 - 8 years,Not Disclosed,Pune,9 days ago,,1824,"Data analytics is the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to derive useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. It involves the use of various techniques and tools to analyze and interpret data, uncover patterns, and extract meaningful insights. Here are some key aspects of data analytics:
Data Collection: The first step in data analytics is collecting relevant data. This can involve gathering data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, sensors, and more. The quality and relevance of the data collected significantly impact the effectiveness of the analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Raw data often contains errors, missing values, or inconsistencies. Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting these issues. Preprocessing includes tasks like normalization, transformation, and feature engineering to prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA involves visually and statistically exploring the data to understand its characteristics. This can include generating summary statistics, creating visualizations, and identifying patterns or trends.
Descriptive Analytics: Descriptive analytics focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. This includes measures such as mean, median, mode, and various visualization techniques to present the data in a meaningful way.
Diagnostic Analytics: Diagnostic analytics involves exploring data to understand why certain events occurred. It aims to identify the factors or variables that contributed to a particular outcome.
Predictive Analytics: Predictive analytics uses statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. This can involve building models to make predictions and understand relationships between variables.
Prescriptive Analytics: Prescriptive analytics goes beyond predicting future outcomes and suggests actions to optimize or improve a situation. It provides recommendations for decision-making.
Data Visualization: Communicating insights effectively is crucial in data analytics. Data visualization techniques, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, are used to present complex information in a way that is easy to understand.
Machine Learning: Machine learning algorithms play a significant role in data analytics, especially in predictive modeling. These algorithms can automatically learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
Big Data Analytics: With the rise of big data, which involves large and complex datasets, specialized techniques and tools are used to process and analyze massive amounts of data efficiently.
Data analytics is applied in various fields, including business, finance, healthcare, marketing, and more. It helps organizations make informed decisions, optimize processes, and gain a competitive advantage by leveraging the insights derived from data.","Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Prescriptive Analytics, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics"
