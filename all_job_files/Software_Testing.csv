Coddle Technologies - Software Test Lead - Manual/Automation Testing,Coddle Technologies Pvt. Ltd.,5 - 10 years,Not Disclosed,Bangalore/Bengaluru,28 days ago,,1932,"Main Duties :

Organising the team : It's advisable to place individuals with different skill sets into separate groups and assign them roles that lead to the efficient completion of a project.

Planning projects : At the start, highlight the project's objectives, policies and strategies with your superiors. It's also usually necessary to make estimates for acquiring the required resources for running the project.

Monitoring the test process : A test lead supervises team members to ensure the test goes to plan. This requires you to be thorough and pay attention to detail.

Conducting software tests : The organisation's management expects you to perform various tests on software applications and computer systems by finding issues and fixing them to ensure quality control. This increases the probability that the final products are of high quality.

Recognising when test automation is appropriate : Automation is a technique where you instal software that performs special automated testing. Deciding when to switch from manual testing to automation is important to maximise the efficiency of the testing process.

Motivating team members : Part of your job involves building the morale of the assigned group members to motivate them and improve work efficiency. This can yield a higher output and improve the working environment.

Cooperating with management : The organisation's management can play a role in your success. Cooperation with management can take place through regular communication with your superiors so you can achieve their project targets.

Writing reports : As the task continues, you register scheduled reports, sometimes weekly, to the project's supervisors. These reports detail job progression and the acquisition of project resources.

Conducting research : As a test lead, you extensively study new advancements in your field. You do this to make future improvements and maintain the current trend for the organisation's benefit.

Software Engineer (Test Infrastructure),Cockroach Labs,3 - 6 years,Not Disclosed,Bangalore/Bengaluru,11 days ago,1,617,"Databases must keep going no matter what. At Cockroach Labs, quality is our number one feature. We are software engineers on a mission to push our product to new frontiers. Our work has a broad-reaching impact on the engineering organisation of over 100 engineers who rely on our tools and methodology to ship a top-notch quality product.
Test Engineering is expanding our investment in next-generation test automation and bug-finding techniques, utilising both randomised and deterministic testing. Note that this is not a QA/manual testing role; all Cockroach Labs engineers write tests and obsess about quality. Test Engineering is a cross-functional team that aims to enable and strengthen the engineering organisation by emphasising correctness and performance testing.
The work encompasses three primary focus areas: Test Infrastructure, Exploratory Testing, and Performance and Scalability. Speaking broadly, Test Infrastructure enables automated test execution, detection of performance regressions, fuzzing, and much more. Exploratory Testing enables new bug-finding techniques such as static and dynamic analysis, metamorphic testing, failure injection, and others. Performance and Scalability enables at-scale benchmarking.
